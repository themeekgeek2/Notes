Low-level programming:
* code similar to machine language (including binary code and Assembly)
* usage for interacting and controlling computer hardware as well as firmware (OS settings, drivers, embedded systems, etc.)

High-level programming:
* code similar to human language (English)
* focus on readability and ease of use (such as Python, Java, C# and Powershell)
* tend to be **object-oriented**, dealing with variables, objects, functions, arrays, Booleans and other data types, rather than registers and call stacks
* a more favorable choice for software and game dev
* unlike low-level languages, it requires a compiler or interpreter to convert to machine code
* more portable

Described as being "close to the hardware"
First-gen programming language
Programs written in Assembly language are non-portable

First-gen (1GL): Machine language designed for the earliest computers. Was difficult to debug and non-portable.

Second-gen (2GL): Assembly language introduced for more ease of use, meant to make machine language more readable. Still non-portable.

Third-gen (3GL): High-level languages that revolutionized programming, as it introduced syntax similar to spoken human language. It abstracted (hid) compilated hardware details. Code able to be compiled into machine code. Portable.


Assembly language has little semantics or formal specification, being only a mapping of human-readable symbols, including symbolic addresses, to opcodes, addresses, numeric constants, strings, etc.

1 machine instruction = 1 Assembly code line } called a mnemonic

Assemblers create object files that can link with other object files or be loaded on their own. 

High-level languages can access low-level programming languages with an inline assembly (low-level code embedded within high-level code)

C considered the 'base' of all programming languages. The C language is particularly impactful due to its flexibility, portability, and ease of use.
C is a general-use language that can be used as a low-level language (what it originally was for, as it was developed in the 1970s as a successor of B) and for high-level programming uses. C can abstract hardware details while being able to still access hardware and firmware.
