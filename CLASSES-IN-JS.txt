OVERVIEW:
objects contains data in the form of properties.
	^methods are functions inside an object
	^OOP languages have the capability of creating classes and objects
	^a class is a blue print for an object


CLASS: a user-defined pattern for an object that defines a set of properties and behaviors, which characterize any object inside the class
	^class properties are data members and methods
	^you can access these properties via dot notation or a send operator


CONSTRUCTOR: an optional method that initializes the attributes of the object
	^automatically called when a new object (instance) of a class is created
	^uses __init__

CLASS VARIABLE: shared by all instances/objects of a class
	^defined within a class, but outside the classes's methods
	^common storage area for objects

INHERITANCE/EXTEND: transfer of a class's characteristics (the base class) to other classes that are derived from it

FUNCTION OVERLOADING: the same function defined with different arguments

INSTANTIATION: creation of a class's instance

OBJECT: unique instance of a data structure that's defined by it's class


Here's an example of a class in python:


class Person:
	fname=''
	lname=''

	
	''' 'self' key word is important to use and refers to the CLASS variable; without it, the code will look for a global var instead. '''

	def names=(self):
		return self.fname + " " + self.lname


'''creating 'patrick' object from the Person class'''

patrick=Person()	# object from Person class

patrick.fname="Patrick" # setting fname for 'pat' object

patrick.lname="Star" # setting lname for pat object


'''creating the 'sb' object from Person class
'''
sb=Person()

sb.fname="SpongeBob"
sb.lname="SquarePants"


'''calling the names() method to print the names'''

print(patrick.names())
print(sb.names())
