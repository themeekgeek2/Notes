# What is read/write (R/W)?
    The capability of a system, device or component to perform both reading and writing operations on data.

    # "Read": refers to the act of accessing info onto a storage medium or memory?

    # "Write": process of saving or recording data onto a storage medium

# What's the difference between a text file and a binary file?

    # A text file is structured as a sequence of lines (lines being a sequence of characters).

    # A binary file is any file BESIDES a text file; can also only be accessed by the application (usually .exe) file that understands the file's structure

# How do I process files?
     Choose a file type and obtains its object and 'open' method. Example: Object_file=open(filename,mode).
            # open() in python returns a file object; most commonly used with two arguments

            # In the example, 'Object_file' is the variable to put the file object in

            # The first arg filename is the full name of the file that needs to be opened; the second arg describes the way that the file will be used

# Explain the 'mode' argument.
    Has values 'r'(read only), 'w'(only writing), 'a'(opens file for appending, adding new data to the end), 'r+'(opens file for reading and writing).

    This argument is optional.

# How can you create a text file in Python?
    Sample code:

    file=open('myfile.txt', 'w')
    print(file) # file object
    file.write('hello, this is my file')
    file.write('\nand this is another line')  # \n used for newline
    file.close() #  closes the file

# How can you read a text file in Python?
    Sample code:

    # This returns a string containing all characters in the file

    file=open('myfile.txt','r')
    print(file.read())

    # You can specify the desired amount of characters to return by using file.read(n)

    # The following code reads the first 7 characters of data and returns it as a string.

    file=open('myfile.txt','r')
    print(file.read(7))

    # To read line-by-line:

    file=open('myfile.txt','r')
    lineno=0

    for line in file:
        lineno=lineno+1
        print(lineno,"",line)

# Explain 'with' statements.
    'With' statements are a good practice to use because it provides better syntax, exception handling, and automatically closes the file.

    Some examples:

    with open('textfile.txt') as file:
        data=file.read()
        # do something with data

    ##

    with open('hello.txt','w') as f:
        f.write('hellow world')


# Demonstrate how to create different file types in Python.

    # Creates a .csv file

    with open('text.csv', 'w') as out_file:
        m=int(input("Enter an integer to create a table."))
        for i in range(11):
            print(i,'*',m,'=',(i*m))
            out_file.write(str(i) + ',' + str(m) + ',' + '=' + str(i*m)+'\n')
        out_file.write("Done\n')

        # Read and write to SQL database

        import sqlite3  # check the path first
        
        connd=sqlite3.connect('chinook.db')  # You can also include a path to the database
        connd=sqlite3.connect(':memory:')  # Syntax for creating the database in the MEMORY

        c=connd.cursor()  # creates a cursor

        # How to create row, insert data and save changes

        c.execute('''CREATE TABLE rolodex (fname text, lname text, Tel text)''')
        c.execute('INSERT INTO rolodex VALUES ('killua','zoldyk','123-456-9999')')
        connd.commit()

        connd.close()  # close the connection

        # TO TEST:

        '''
        import sqlite3
        connd=sqlite3.connect('chinook.db')

        c=connd.cursor()

        for row in c.execute('SELECT * FROM rolodex ORDER BY 1'):
            print(row)  # should print the data rows


        '''
