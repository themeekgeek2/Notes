## Computer Hardware



**Hardware** refers to the components: CPU, RAM,  motherboard, computer data storage sound card, computer case, and external devices such as the monitor, mouse, keyboard, speakers and other peripheral devices.

* Typically directed by the software to execute a command or instructions, and a combo of hardware and software forms a usable computer system.



A computer's **architecture** involves balancing several factors such as cost, speed, availability and energy efficiency.





**Microarchitecture/computer organization**: high-level hardware design such as CPU design, memory and memory interconnect

* Memory typically separated from programs and data to limit an attacker's ability to alter programs
* Most computers use virtual memory to simplify addressing for programs, using the OS to map the virtual memory to different areas of the finite physical memory



Processors generate heat from its large amount of used power, and excessive heat can hinder hardware/software components, harming them in extreme situations.

* For this reason, many computers utilize cooling systems/mechanics (e.g. heatsinks, air or liquid CPU coolers, ventilated computer cases, direct-to-chip cooling (cooling fluid is directed to each computer chip).
* **Sustained operations cannot exceed the capacity of the cooling system.**
* While performance can be temporarily increased when the computer's NOT hot (called '**overclocking**'), the system will automatically reduce performance or shut down if necessary to protect the hardware.





### Types of computer hardware systems



Personal computers (desktop PC, laptops, tablets, mobile phones)



Large-scale computers (mainframe computers-big enough to fit an entire room, minicomputers, supercomputers, cluster/warehouse scale)



Virtual hardware: software mimicking the function of hardware; frequently used in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS)



Embedded systems:





### Toxic computer components



The CPU contains several toxic materials. It may include lead and chromium in metal plates. Resistors, semiconductors, infrared detectors, stabilizers, cables and wires can contain cadmium, while computer circuit boards may also contain mercury AND chromium.
