script:

create a script for javascript console that removes all ads and CSS when ran

possibly a recreate in powershell (no need-more for automating repetitive tasks; would require executing selenium and/or CDP back-to-back just to load up a DOM script-unnecessary.)

how to check if i have selenium installed on my system-powershell--> ```Get-Module -ListAvailable *selenium*```



for copilot:

what are the steps for creating a powershell script that automatically runs in a certain browser when commanded to? would the script be able to work with a web extension like tampermonkey? this would basically be a form of browser automation.

"set up the environment so that powershell opens the browser in a specific way, and tampermonkey reacts to the page."

powershell for browser automation:
* launch a specific browser with arguments (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
* open URLs, profiles, custom flags, etc.
* use with frameworks such as Selenium Webdriver "for full control"
* Use CDP/BiDi protocol wrappers (like the GitHub project in the search results) to script browser actions

powershell CANNOT:
* directly inject javascript into a browser tab
* directly control browser extensions
* directly manipulate tampermonkey (however, it can trigger the conditions under which Tampermonkey runs)

Tampermonkey runs userscripts that can:
* modify the page
* automate clicks
*fill forms
*observe DOM changes
*run logic on page load

Automation chain with Powershell and Tampermonkey used together:
Powershell opens browser and loads the url; Tampermonkey script executes after URL loads

Tampermonkey runs INSIDE the browser
Powershell runs OUTSIDE the browser
They interact through:
* URLs
* Query parameters
* Local files
* Browser files
*Custom set triggers

Powershell CANNOT directly interact with a browser for these reasons:
1.) It runs at the OS level, meaning that it simply interacts with Windows commands and processes that tell it to do something.

2.) It can modify webpage files, such as HTML, CSS, and JS, because they are only local files.

3.) Browsers block things like malware, scripts from reading tabs, external code-injecting programs and OS-level DOM manipulation tools for security purposes.


Analogy of Selenium (web framework) to CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol):
Selenium = driving a car using the steering wheel and pedals
(standard, safe, consistent)
CDP = plugging into the car’s onboard computer and controlling it electronically
(faster, deeper, more powerful, but more technical)
