From Copilot:

1. What does Out-Null do for the 'if' statement?
	Out-Null throws away output. It's to avoid Powershell commands returning objects (as a DirectoryInfo object) and printing it to the screen. Piping a command to Out-Null helps declutter the screen.
	
	Out-Null is used in 'if' blocks to basically not print the results of the command on screen.

2. Why use Where-Object instead of ForEach-Object?
	They're two separate commands with different functions.
	
	Where-Object is used for FILTERING- it keeps only items that match a certain condition. For example, it says "Give me only files newer tlhan 10 days."
	
	ForEach-Object performs an action on each item. It's saying "for each ZIP, extract it."
	This cmdlet can be used for filtering, but it's very clunky and not for idiomatic (intended purpose) of Powershell, which is designed to be more readable in contrast to Batch/Windows CMD.
	
	This is Where-Object filtering:
	
	Get-ChildItem $dowf -Filter *.zip |
    Where-Object { $_.LastWriteTime -gt (Get-Date).AddDays(-10) }
	
	VS. ForEach-Object filtering:
	
	Get-ChildItem $dowf | ForEach-Object {
    if ($_.LastWriteTime -gt (Get-Date).AddDays(-10)) { $_ }
}

3. What does $_. mean in Powershell?
	Refers to the pipeline's current object.
	It's comparable to '%%i' in Batch, but it's more powerfull since it's a full object instead of a string (less efficient for manipulation).
	
	For example:
	Get-ChildItem $dowf -Filter *.zip |
    Where-Object { $_.LastWriteTime -gt (Get-Date).AddDays(-10) }
	
	Here, '$_' is a FileInfo object with properties such as .Name, .FullName, .Extension, .LastWriteTime. Listed, it'd look like:
	
	$_.Name
	$_.FullName
	$_.Extension
	$_.LastWriteTime

	Batch could never do this, as it only displays text instead of actual objects.

4. When to use ForEach-Object vs. foreach vs. Where-Object keywords in Powershell scripting? (basically what the difference is between ps looping keywords and their functions)

	Where-Object for filtering
	
	ForEach-Object as a pipeline loop (does something to each item as it flows through a pipeline)
	
	foreach (keyword) for looping over a COLLECTION already in memory; for more 'traditional' loops, often faster and cleaner than ForEach-Object
