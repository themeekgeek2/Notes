curses wrapper takes functions, initialize the module and pass the initialize object to the function

stdscr=standard output=your console
basically generates a screen on top of the terminal and refreshes when stated in code

curses needs to be directly run in the terminal for it to output correctly
need to change terminal directory to be in the folder containing the code

getch()=get character

use stdscr.addstr("") instead of print() because print() goes directly to the command-line instead of the screen
