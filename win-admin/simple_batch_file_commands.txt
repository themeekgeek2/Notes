BATCH FILE HOW-TOs

To write a file:
	open Notepad or text file
	type commands line-by-line
	save file with .bat extension
	open the windows command line
	open batch file

Basic commands:

echo = displays text

@echo off = hides commands being executed

pause = pauses script execution, waiting for the user to press a key

rem = adds comments (ignored by the system)


More commands:

file operation: 	copy, del, dir, mkdir, rmdir, cd, ver
variable manipulation:		set, echo%variable%
conditionals:		if
looping:	for


cls = clear screen

@ = used before any command hides which command is running.

help = provides all commands in the cmd (only runs if cmd is running as an admin)
